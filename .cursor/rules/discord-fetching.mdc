# Discord Data Fetching

The primary source for fetching raw Discord message and user data is [src/plugins/sources/DiscordRawDataSource.ts](mdc:src/plugins/sources/DiscordRawDataSource.ts).

Key aspects:
- It implements the `ContentSource` interface defined in [src/plugins/sources/ContentSource.ts](mdc:src/plugins/sources/ContentSource.ts).
- It fetches data for specific channels (`channelIds`) within a given guild (`guildId`).
- It uses the `fetchHistorical` method for fetching data for a specific date (does not use cursors for this).
- The `fetchChannelMessages` method contains the core logic for pagination, rate limiting, and date filtering for a single channel (used by `fetchHistorical`).
- The `fetchItems` method (for fetching *recent* items) uses the `StoragePlugin` (configured during initialization, likely via [src/plugins/storage/SQLiteStorage.ts](mdc:src/plugins/storage/SQLiteStorage.ts)) to manage cursors (last fetched message ID per channel) to avoid refetching. Cursor keys are constructed like `${this.name}-${channel.id}`.
- The fetched data structure is defined by the `DiscordRawData` interface in [src/types.ts](mdc:src/types.ts).
- Helper functions from [src/helpers/](mdc:src/helpers) (like `retryOperation`, `delay`, `createProgressBar`, `logger`) are used extensively.
