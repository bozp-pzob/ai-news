# Plugin System Architecture

The news aggregator uses a modular plugin system organized in the [src/plugins](mdc:src/plugins) directory.

## Plugin Categories

### Sources
Located in `src/plugins/sources/`
- News source plugins for different platforms and APIs
- Each plugin implements a standard interface for data collection

### Enrichers
Located in `src/plugins/enrichers/`
- Content enrichment plugins
- Add metadata, categorization, and additional context to news items

### AI Integration
Located in `src/plugins/ai/`
- AI-powered processing and analysis
- Integration with language models and AI services

### Generators
Located in `src/plugins/generators/`
- Content generation plugins
- Transform and format news data for different outputs

### Storage
Located in `src/plugins/storage/`
- Database and storage plugins
- Handle data persistence and retrieval

## Plugin Development
New plugins should be added to their respective category directories and follow the type definitions in [src/types.ts](mdc:src/types.ts).
